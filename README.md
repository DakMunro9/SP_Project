### Objective

Your challenge is to build out this full-stack todo app and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

### Brief

Using any language or framework, your task is to build out the project to the designs inside the `/design` folder. The designs are in JPG static format. This will mean that you'll need to use your best judgment for styles such as `font-size`, `padding` and `margin`. There is also a `style-guide.md` file, which contains the information you'll need, such as color palette and fonts.

**Client Side**

Your users should be able to:

-   Add new todos to the list
-   Mark todos as complete
-   Delete todos from the list
-   Filter by all/active/complete todos
-   Clear all completed todos
-   See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
-  Toggle light and dark mode
-  Drag and drop to reorder items on the list

**Server Side**

-   Design a simple API for persisting state on the server side
-   Implement routes for all listed **CRUD** operations
-   No authentication / session management is required. Imagine you're building this application for a single user (yourself)
